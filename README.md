This is yet another 2d tiny game engine project.

You can ask me, why should you create another game engine?
Why don't you just use "YouFavouriteGameEngine"?
And here's the answer:
- I want to have additional practice in writing code
- I want to have some fun creating funny things
- I want to have nice and tiny tool for creating simple games
- I want to have some non-commercial code to show and share
